          I’m a street and documentary photographer — and a budget traveler — among other things, loosely based in Stockholm, Sweden. I explore life on the margins: red light alleys in Thailand, sleepy Asian towns, right-wing extremists, obscure villages by ancient rivers, refugees, genocide memorials, poor gutters, and forgotten corners of the Balkans.
          <br /><br />
          I’ve biked across Europe along the eastern edge of the Iron Curtain, from Scandinavia to Turkey. I walk a lot, shoot way too many photos, and edit excruciatingly slowly — always aiming to capture people the way they’d want to be remembered… or at least not forgotten.

          I’m currently on a break from coding, except for this website, which I started developing in April 2025. I thought it was about time.
          <br /> <br />
          Otherwise I still feel too restless for office life — as an old manager once asked me:
        </p>


        <blockquote className="mt-10 text-xl font-serif mb-2">
          “Should we chain you to your chair?”

        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
          Maybe he should’ve. <br />
          Now I’ve got no time for that. <br />
          I’m out capturing people of my own.
