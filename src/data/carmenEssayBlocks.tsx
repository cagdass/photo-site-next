    It quickly became my go-to. One of the cheapest bars in Södermalm. No music, no posh waiters — just chatter. Which, for me, was ideal. I’ve always hated shouting over loud basslines, or splashing on organic craft beer. My Welsh friend used to say it was the only place in Stockholm that resembled the pubs back home. Small tables, packed close. A little dark. A little intimate.`,

Took portraits of friends, regulars, drunks, and whoever else sat still long enough.`,

          I made it a habit of going in just to grab a beer after work anyways. I would also talk to new faces, snap some photos, and head home. I was happy with having a long-term project where I would collect photos, I saw it as my own little <em>Café Lehmitz</em> — a long-term project in a single bar. Funny enough, Anders Petersen doesn’t live too far from Carmen either.
